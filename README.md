# SpectreConsoleQrCodeDemo
Sample on how to write a QR code to the console using [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder) and [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console).

___Note:___ The more content you add to the QR-code, the more "pixels" it will require.
       As a pixel is represented as an ASCII-char in the console it might be quite large.
       I've noted that large QR-codes requires the user to scale down the font size to fit the QR code on a normal screen.
